3rd year Major Project

This is a work in progress code from my third year major project in Computer Visualisation & Animation course at Bournemout University. 

The code implements a tool for real-time shader authoring. The programs transforms a node network into corresponding GLSL code. The nodes are represented in XML and the node network is transformed into GLSL by using XSLT processor. 

This implementation uses following 3rd party libraries:
[boost](http://www.boost.org/)
[libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/)
[libxslta(]http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/)
[stl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library)

More detailed description and some implementation details can be found at my blog:

This project is a continuum to my previous work with GLSL/OpenGL wtih deferred shading and the final goal of the project is to replicate the shader code using this framework.
